# Python has functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

# Open a file
myFile = open('myfile.txt', 'w')

# Get some info
print('Name: ', myFile.name)
print('Is Closed : ', myFile.closed)
print('Opening Mode: ', myFile.mode)

# Write to file
myFile.write('I love Python')
myFile.write(' and JavaScript')
myFile.close()

# Append to file
myFile = open('myfile.txt', 'a')
myFile.write(' I also like PHP')
myFile.close()

# Read from file
myFile = open('myfile.txt', 'r+')
text = myFile.read(100)
print(text)

from pathlib import Path
file_path=Path("bab.txt")
if file_path.exists():
    print("the file exist")
else:
    print("file not exist")

3)To read and write csv file 
csv reader and writer operation
import csv
data=[["name","age","year"],
      ["deva","23","2001"],
      ["x","22","2002"],
      ["y","30","1995"]]
with open("studen.csv",mode="w",newline="") as file:
    writer=csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
    
To read a csv file
import csv
with open("studen.csv",mode="r") as file:
    reader=csv.reader(file)
    header=next(reader) # this method reads the header
    print(header,"\n")
    for word in reader:
        print(word)

4)Handling csv files with dict
import csv
ex-
data = [
    {"Name": "Alice", "Age": 30, "City": "New York"},
    {"Name": "Bob", "Age": 25, "City": "Los Angeles"},
    {"Name": "Charlie", "Age": 35, "City": "Chicago"}
]
with open('studen.csv', mode='w',newline="") as file:
    feildname=["Name","Age","City"]
    csv_reader = csv.DictWriter(file,fieldnames=feildname)
    csv_reader.writeheader()
    csv_reader.writerows(data)
    
Dealing with zipfiles
write mode operation
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile("abc.zip","w") as zipf:
    zipf.write("hello.txt")
    zipf.write("abc.txt")

Read Mode
import zipfile
with zipfile>zipFile("abc.zip","r") as zipf:
       zipf.extractall("extarctedzip")

pickling and pickling of objects
pickling - serializing the objects in a file
unpickling - deserializing the objects in a file
to do this we need a module called pickle
i)#pickling
ex- 
import pickle
obj=["yash","prabhas","vijay","deva"]
obj1=["yash","prabhas","vijay","deva"]
with open("file.pkl","wb") as pkl:
   pickle.dump(obj,pkl)
   pickle.dump(obj1,pkl)

#here "wb" is a write binary

ii)desirializing file or unpickling the objects

import pickle
obj=["yash","prabhas","vijay","deva"]
obj1=["yash","prabhas","vijay","deva"]
with open("file.pkl","rb") as pkl:
   a=pickle.load(pkl)
   print(a)
#here "rb" is read binary

working with directories
#make a directory using the makedirs() method
import os
os.makedirs("new_folder")

#to change directory use the method chdir()
os.chdir("new_folder")
print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())  # Prints the current directory

#using listdir() method to list directories and files
print(os.listdir())#if it is current directory
print(os.listdir("new_folder"))#if the directory is diffrent

#to check whether directory exist or not path.isdir() method in os
if os.path.isdir("new_folder"):
    print("Directory exists")
else:
    print("Directory does not exist")
