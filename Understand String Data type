What is a String?
A string in programming is a sequence of characters enclosed within single (') or double quotes ("). 
It is typically used to represent text. In most programming languages, strings are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.

string1 = "Hello, World!"
string2 = 'Python is awesome'

String Functions
Here are some commonly used string functions (using Python as an example):

len(): Returns the length of the string.

len("Hello")  # Output: 5
lower(): Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.

"HELLO".lower()  # Output: "hello"
upper(): Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.

"hello".upper()  # Output: "HELLO"
strip(): Removes any leading or trailing whitespaces.

"   Hello   ".strip()  # Output: "Hello"
replace(): Replaces a substring with another string.

"Hello World".replace("World", "Python")  # Output: "Hello Python"
split(): Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter.

"Hello,World".split(",")  # Output: ['Hello', 'World']
join(): Joins elements of a list into a string.


", ".join(['Hello', 'World'])  # Output: "Hello, World"
find(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.


"Hello World".find("World")  # Output: 6
startswith() / endswith(): Checks if the string starts/ends with a particular substring.

"Hello".startswith("He")  # Output: True
"Hello".endswith("lo")    # Output: True
String Formatting
String formatting is a way to embed variables inside strings.


name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
# Output: "My name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
Using format() method:

message = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format("Alice", 25)
# Output: "My name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
Using % operator:

message = "My name is %s and I am %d years old." % ("Alice", 25)
# Output: "My name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
String-Based Programs
Here are a few example programs using strings:

Reverse a String:

string = "Hello"
reversed_string = string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)  # Output: "olleH"
Check if a String is a Palindrome:

string = "madam"
if string == string[::-1]:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not a palindrome")
Count Vowels in a String:

string = "Hello World"
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
count = sum(1 for char in string if char in vowels)
print(count)  # Output: 3
Remove Spaces from a String:

string = "Hello World"
no_space_string = string.replace(" ", "")
print(no_space_string)  # Output: "HelloWorld"
Find Frequency of Characters:

string = "banana"
frequency = {}
for char in string:
    frequency[char] = frequency.get(char, 0) + 1
print(frequency)  # Output: {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}
